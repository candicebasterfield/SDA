Software development web app


This project is a tool designed to simulate random events, providing users with interactive visualizations and an easy-to-use dashboard interface. 

The tool uses Streamlit to create a web-based interface and Plotly Express for generating visualizations like histograms and scatter plots.

 It is developed in Python and intended to be run locally on a user's machine.
